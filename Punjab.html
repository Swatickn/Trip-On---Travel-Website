                <p class="text">Anandpur Sahib, located in the Rupnagar district of Punjab, is one of the most important sacred places for Sikhs. Known as the “Holy City of Bliss,” it was founded in 1665 by Guru Tegh Bahadur, the ninth Sikh Guru. The city holds deep historical and spiritual significance as it was here that Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth Sikh Guru, founded the Khalsa in 1699, marking a defining moment in Sikh history.
            <br>
               Apart from its religious significance, Anandpur Sahib is surrounded by scenic hills and the Sutlej River, offering a peaceful environment for visitors.

                <p class="text">The Golden Temple, also known as Harmandir Sahib, is the most revered spiritual site of Sikhism, located in the heart of Amritsar, Punjab. Built in the 16th century by Guru Arjan Dev Ji, it symbolizes equality, humility, and brotherhood. The temple’s stunning architecture blends Hindu and Islamic styles, with its gold-plated sanctum shimmering in the middle of the sacred Amrit Sarovar (holy tank). Pilgrims from across the globe visit to experience its peaceful aura and participate in prayers and hymns that resonate throughout the complex.
            <br>
              One of the most remarkable aspects of the Golden Temple is its Langar (community kitchen), which serves free meals to thousands of visitors daily, regardless of religion, caste, or background. This tradition, started by Guru Nanak Dev Ji, emphasizes the Sikh principle of “seva” (selfless service) and unity. The sight of volunteers tirelessly cooking, serving, and cleaning is deeply humbling and inspiring for all who visit.
