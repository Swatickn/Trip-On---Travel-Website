                <p class="text">Durga Puja, the grandest festival of West Bengal, is a vibrant celebration honoring Goddess Durga’s victory over the demon Mahishasura. Held every year in the month of Ashwin (September–October), this five-day festival fills the air with devotion, artistry, and cultural splendor. Cities like Kolkata, Howrah, and Siliguri transform into open-air galleries, with intricately crafted pandals (temporary structures) housing stunning idols of the goddess. The festival is more than just a religious observance—it is an emotion that unites people across communities.
            <br>
              The preparations for Durga Puja begin months in advance, with artisans in Kumartuli (Kolkata’s idol-making hub) meticulously shaping clay idols of Durga and her children—Lakshmi, Saraswati, Kartik, and Ganesha. Each pandal is themed uniquely, ranging from traditional temple replicas to modern art installations, making pandal-hopping a visual feast. The rhythmic beats of dhaak (traditional drums), the fragrance of incense, and the chanting of mantras create a deeply spiritual atmosphere.      
            <br>
             Durga Puja is also a celebration of culture and community. Evenings are filled with performances of dance, drama, and music. Stalls around pandals serve mouth-watering Bengali delicacies like phuchka, kathi rolls, ilish maach, and mishti doi. People wear their best traditional attire, with sarees, kurta-pajamas, and vibrant ornaments adding to the festive charm. On Ashtami, the sacred pushpanjali (flower offering) is performed, and on Dashami, married women smear each other with vermillion in the traditional Sindoor Khela before bidding farewell to the goddess.

              Apart from the tigers, the Sundarbans is home to saltwater crocodiles, spotted deer, fishing cats, monitor lizards, and hundreds of bird species. The forest is crisscrossed by rivers, tidal channels, and creeks, making it accessible only by boats. This creates an adventurous experience as visitors explore watchtowers like Sajnekhali, Sudhanyakhali, and Dobanki, which offer stunning views of wildlife and the mangrove landscape.      
            <br>
