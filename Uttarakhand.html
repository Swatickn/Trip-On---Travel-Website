                <p class="text">Khait Parvat, nestled in the serene landscapes of Uttarakhand, is not just known for its breathtaking natural beauty but also for the mysterious tales that surround it. Locals often whisper about unexplained disappearances of cattle and strange lights flickering on moonless nights atop the mountain. Some say these lights are spirits guarding the mountain, while others believe they are signs of hidden treasures buried centuries ago. The thick fog that frequently engulfs the peak adds to the eerie atmosphere, making it a favorite spot for mystery seekers and storytellers alike.
            <br>
             The mountain is also linked to ancient folklore that speaks of a forgotten civilization that once thrived here. According to legend, an entire village vanished overnight under mysterious circumstances, leaving behind only faint stone structures hidden deep in the forested slopes. Trekkers have reported hearing distant drum beats and chants, especially during the late hours, even though no human settlements exist nearby.       
            <br>
             Adventure enthusiasts and thrill seekers often hike to Khait Parvat not just for its scenic views, but in search of these strange phenomena. The winding trails through dense pine and oak forests feel almost enchanted, and the shifting shadows play tricks on the eyes. Many say the mountain has a magnetic pull that keeps calling visitors back, as if it hides answers to unsolved riddles.
