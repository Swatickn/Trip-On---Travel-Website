                <p class="text">Unakoti, located in the Kailashahar subdivision of Tripura, is a fascinating archaeological and pilgrimage site famous for its massive rock-cut sculptures and stone carvings dating back to the 7th–9th centuries. The name "Unakoti" literally means "one less than a crore," and local legend says that Lord Shiva once halted here with 99,99,999 gods and goddesses on his way to Kashi, but only he woke up in time — the rest were turned to stone. This mythical backstory adds a layer of mystique to the site’s already awe-inspiring charm.
            <br>
             The highlight of Unakoti is the towering 30-foot-high bust of Lord Shiva, known as Unakotiswara Kal Bhairava, along with intricate carvings of deities like Goddess Durga and Ganesha. The artistry reflects both religious devotion and the cultural heritage of ancient northeastern India. The carvings, etched into lush green hills, are surrounded by waterfalls and forest, creating a magical blend of history and nature.       
            <br>
               The site is also an important pilgrimage destination, particularly during the annual Ashokashtami Mela, which attracts devotees from across the region. During this festival, the area comes alive with rituals, prayers, and cultural programs, making it the best time for visitors who want to witness its spiritual vibrance. For those more inclined toward heritage tourism, the peaceful environment outside of festival days offers an excellent chance to explore and photograph the carvings without large crowds.

            <br>
              The palace is divided into two sections — the western side for royal residence and the eastern side for cultural programs and performances. Surrounded by lush gardens, open terraces, and decorative towers, Neer Mahal offers visitors a glimpse into the luxurious lifestyle of Tripura’s former royalty. Its setting in the middle of the lake means that visitors must take a boat ride to reach it, adding a sense of adventure and romance to the experience.
