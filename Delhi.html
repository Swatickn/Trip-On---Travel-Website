                <p class="text">The Red Fort, located in the heart of Delhi, is one of India’s most iconic monuments and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in 1648, the fort served as the main residence of the Mughal emperors for nearly 200 years. Its massive red sandstone walls, stretching over 2 kilometers, give the fort its name and grand appearance.
            <br>
             Architecturally, the Red Fort is a stunning example of Mughal design, blending Persian, Timurid, and Indian styles. Inside, you’ll find impressive structures such as the Diwan-i-Aam (Hall of Public Audience), Diwan-i-Khas (Hall of Private Audience), Rang Mahal, and beautifully landscaped gardens. Each corner of the fort whispers tales of imperial grandeur and historical events.       
            <br>
             Apart from its historical importance, the fort holds immense cultural significance. Every year on India’s Independence Day, the Prime Minister hoists the national flag here, followed by an inspiring speech, making it a focal point of national pride.

                <p class="text">India Gate, located in the heart of New Delhi, is one of the country’s most significant war memorials. Designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and inaugurated in 1931, it stands as a tribute to over 70,000 Indian soldiers who lost their lives during World War I and in other conflicts. The grand archway, built in red and pale sandstone, is reminiscent of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris and carries the names of more than 13,000 soldiers inscribed on its surface.
            <br>
              Surrounded by lush green lawns, India Gate is a popular spot for both tourists and locals, especially during the evenings when the monument is beautifully illuminated. Families, couples, and friends often gather here to enjoy the peaceful ambiance and open spaces. The sight of the national flag fluttering nearby fills the heart with patriotic pride.      
            <br>
               Beneath the archway lies the Amar Jawan Jyoti, an eternal flame that burns in memory of the soldiers who sacrificed their lives in the Indo-Pak war of 1971. This solemn site is guarded round the clock and serves as a poignant reminder of India’s bravery and resilience.     
            <br>
             The area around India Gate is also vibrant, with street vendors selling local snacks, ice cream, and souvenirs, making it a lively yet respectful place to visit. Night strolls here, with the monument glowing in the backdrop, are especially enchanting.

                <p class="text">Qutub Minar, located in Delhi’s Mehrauli area, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of India’s most iconic monuments. Standing tall at 73 meters, it is the tallest brick minaret in the world and a fine example of Indo-Islamic architecture. Commissioned in 1192 by Qutb-ud-din Aibak and later completed by his successors, the tower is made of red sandstone and marble, adorned with intricate carvings and verses from the Quran.
            <br>
             Surrounding the minaret is the Qutub Complex, which houses several historical structures, including the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque, Alai Darwaza, and the famous Iron Pillar of Delhi that has resisted rust for over 1,600 years. The complex reflects the architectural brilliance of the Delhi Sultanate and offers visitors a fascinating journey into India’s medieval past.       
            <br>
             The minar’s five distinct storeys, separated by balconies with intricate stone railings, display varying architectural styles, showcasing the contributions of different rulers. Though entry to the top is now restricted, standing at the base and looking up at the towering structure is awe-inspiring.       
            <br>
              Qutub Minar is also a popular cultural hub, hosting the annual Qutub Festival where classical music and dance performances take place under the night sky, making it a magical experience for history and culture lovers alike.

            <br>
               The tomb is surrounded by the Charbagh-style gardens, divided into four parts by water channels, symbolizing the Islamic concept of paradise.
