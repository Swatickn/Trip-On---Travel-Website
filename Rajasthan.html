                <p class="text">Hawa Mahal, also known as the “Palace of Winds,” is one of Jaipur’s most iconic landmarks and a masterpiece of Rajput architecture. Built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, this stunning structure was designed by Lal Chand Ustad with the purpose of allowing royal ladies to observe street festivities without being seen. Its unique five-story façade, adorned with 953 small windows or jharokhas, resembles a honeycomb and is crafted from red and pink sandstone, blending perfectly with Jaipur’s vibrant architectural style.
            <br>
               The design of Hawa Mahal is a fine example of the fusion between Rajput and Mughal architectural styles. The intricate latticework not only adds to its beauty but also allows cool air to pass through, keeping the palace naturally ventilated — a practical feature for the hot Rajasthani climate. This architectural brilliance makes it a favorite spot for photographers and history enthusiasts alike.     
            <br>
            Inside, the Hawa Mahal has narrow passages and small chambers, each offering stunning views of Jaipur’s bustling streets and the City Palace complex. Though the façade is the most photographed part, climbing to the top floors rewards visitors with panoramic views of the Pink City, Jantar Mantar, and Sireh Deori Bazaar.        
            <br>
              Visiting Hawa Mahal is a journey into Rajasthan’s regal past, offering a glimpse into the lifestyle of the royal women and the ingenuity of traditional architecture. The area around the palace is also perfect for exploring Jaipur’s colorful markets and savoring authentic Rajasthani cuisine.

                <p class="text">Nahargarh Fort, perched on the rugged Aravalli Hills overlooking Jaipur, is a magnificent structure that offers a blend of history, architecture, and breathtaking views. Built in 1734 by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, the founder of Jaipur, the fort served as a retreat for the royal family. Its strategic location also made it an important defense structure, forming a trio of forts alongside Amer Fort and Jaigarh Fort.
            <br>
              The fort’s architecture is a fine example of Indo-European style, with elaborate corridors, intricately decorated rooms, and beautiful courtyards. The palace within the fort, known as Madhavendra Bhawan, was designed as a summer retreat with separate suites for the king and his queens, all connected by corridors adorned with delicate frescoes and murals.
      
            <br>
               Nahargarh Fort is also famous for its panoramic views of Jaipur, especially at sunset when the city glows in golden hues. Over the years, it has gained popularity as a leisure spot, with cafés and restaurants inside the fort offering a chance to enjoy snacks while admiring the cityscape. It has also been featured in several Bollywood films, adding to its modern charm.     
            <br>

                <p class="text">Jal Mahal, meaning “Water Palace,” is one of Jaipur’s most enchanting landmarks, floating serenely in the middle of the Man Sagar Lake. Built in the 18th century by Maharaja Madho Singh I as a hunting lodge and summer retreat, this architectural marvel beautifully combines Rajput and Mughal styles. Its unique location and striking symmetry make it a photographer’s delight.
            <br>
               The palace appears to have only one floor, but in reality, four of its five stories are submerged underwater when the lake is full. Its red sandstone walls and arched balconies reflect gracefully in the shimmering waters, creating a dreamy visual. The surrounding Aravalli Hills and the lush Nahargarh forests enhance its charm, making it a tranquil escape from the city’s hustle.     
            <br>
               Although entry inside the Jal Mahal is restricted to the public, visitors can admire it from the banks or enjoy boat rides that offer a closer view. In recent years, restoration efforts have brought back the palace’s grandeur, and the lake area has become a favorite spot for evening strolls, birdwatching, and photography     
            <br>
               The setting of Jal Mahal is particularly magical at sunrise and sunset, when the changing colors of the sky cast a golden or pink glow over the waters. Its serene ambiance makes it one of Jaipur’s most romantic and picturesque attractions.

Built in 1726 by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, this imposing fort was designed to protect the Amer Fort and its palace complex. Its robust structure, thick walls, and strategic location make it one of the most well-preserved forts in Rajasthan.
            <br>
             One of the main highlights of Jaigarh Fort is the Jaivana Cannon, once the world’s largest cannon on wheels. Although it was never used in battle, it remains a testament to the Rajput kings’ military preparedness. The fort also houses an intricate water harvesting system, palaces, gardens, and an armory, offering a glimpse into the ingenuity and grandeur of the Rajput era.
